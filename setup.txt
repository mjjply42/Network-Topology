Network Connection:

To run the program, just type "Node App". That will start all of the processes based on the configuration files.
To test a demo response, open up a seperate terminal and 'Curl" one of the open ports: "curl localhost:5000".
The goal was to get any server setup that was given in the configure files, and then curl request from any port,
and allow communication through its connected nodes, based on socket communication and open ports. The console
prints out non duplicate port responses on a single pass through a "network". All paths through every node require
a slight modification to the code. I did not want to have a long list printing out.

Network Topology:

Going to the browser at the specified port ("localhost:7000"), will show you the current network topology. 

Configure Files:
Are all stored in the directory Config. More will be added on a later version. This was sent to show the work done.
As I have spent a too much time getting this solution as is.

Testing:
The project testing is incomplete. This is the first verson, without testing. I wanted to get this over to you ASAP.
